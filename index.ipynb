    "We have now covered Python classes, instance objects, instance methods, and instance variables. Now that we know what these things are and how they work together, we need to think about how we *want* these parts of our program to work together. Said another way, we need to think about making our programs a bit more secure and prevent users from making unwanted changes or creating bad data. To that effect, we will want to use design patterns for creating private instance variables or defining instance methods that provide ways to update instance variables indirectly. These methods are called setters and getters, because they both read and write (get and set) the private instance variable information we would like to access. Let's get started!"

    "Okay, so, we now have methods that allow us to change our account balance without having to access the account balance directly. On top of that, we have other instance methods that are preventing someone from making an unwanted or an unallowed action.

If we don't make sure our input is a number, we leave ourselves vulnerable to errors, and errors are no good. \n",

After all, they are both just changing the balance and naming these functions another way can make it hard to implement a convention. This is where **property()** comes into play. Before we dig too much into what property is, let's look at how it works."
