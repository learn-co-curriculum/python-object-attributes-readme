    "We have now covered Python classes, instance objects, instance methods, and instance variables. Now that we know what these things are and how they work together, we need to think about how we *want* these parts of our program to work together. Said another way, we need to think about making our programs a bit more secure and prevent users from making unwanted changes or creating bad data. To that effect, we will want to use design patterns for creating private instance variables or defining instance methods that provide ways to update instance variables indirectly. These methods are called setters and getters, because they both read and write (get and set) the private instance variable information we would like to access. Let's get started!"

You have to have a minimum balance to open your account, you need to maintain a certain balance, you cannot overdraft your account without incurring a fee, etc. All of those things, current balance, balance minimum, max withdrawal amount, over draft fees can call be thought about as attributes of a bank account. If you know of a bank that doesn't have these *attributes*, **please** let the rest of us know.\n",

Before we dig too much into what property is, let's look at how it works."
